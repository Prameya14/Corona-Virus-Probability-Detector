            This Application gives you the percentage of Infection in your body due to Corona Virus. You need to fill the form in the home page and then you will be provided with the percentage of infection. You will also get a status of your infection along with the percentage. Also, if your percentage of infection is high then please consider consulting a Medical Specialist for better advices.

            Requirement of this Detector:
        </h3>
        <h5 class="h5">
            As we know that the growing cases of Corona Virus have affected our day-to-day life a lot. Many of us have lost our jobs, many have lost their dearer and neared ones and many more are stilling suffering from this virus. We have already faced to Waves of this Virus, but now we need to be extremenly serious to stop the third wave. The most commonly heard problem in this pandemic is shortage of Medical Resources. Where the cases are increasing day by day we are just falling short of the required resources. To stop this, I am providing my Idea and Solution to this Problem.

            My Idea for this Detector:
        </h3>
        <h5 class="h5">
            The idea of my project is that a set of doctors should sit and discuss about the mostly seen symptoms of this Virus such as Loss of Taste, Smell, Body Pain, Sneezing, Coughing etc. They should make a complete data set by testing the symptoms of those people who have been tested COVID Positive and Negative. After that we can work on that data and create a ML Model for better predictions. Then according to that prediction we should provide the resources to the people. For example who has been surveyed a high percentage of infection, should be provided with the required resources first.

                    Note: This model is not ready to use. It is based on random data. It needs to be trained using actual data.

            My Solution:
        </h3>
        <h5 class="h5">
            I have actually made a Website and an Android App which is kind of a form that the people need to fill for themselves to be clarified that they require being hospitalised or not so that the right person can get the right resources and on time. The data I am using is completely random but for this model to be used we need to get actual data which will be provided by a set of healthcare specialists.

            Working of this App:
        </h3>
        <h5 class="h5">
            This model is trained on the Logistic Regression Algorithm of a Python Library called Scikit Learn. The model is trained with Random Data generated using MS Excel and stored in an CSV File. Then the model predicts according to the inputs of the user.
